This project dynamically generates a static page with favorite movies.

To adapt the movies shown on the page, open media_library.py and modify the movie instances.

To dynamically generate the page, go to the project root in your terminal and run the media_library.py file:

python media_library.py

A fresh_tomatoes.html file will be generated and opened in a new browser session.
